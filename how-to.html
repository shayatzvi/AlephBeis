    <h1>How to play Aleph Beis Adventure</h1>
<p>The game is split in to 2 different ways to play. Either select the level you want to try, or start from the beggining and work your way up!</p>
    <h2>How to play the game to work your way up</h2>
    <p>Starting from the bottom is a good way to start learning. Load the page, and it will immediatly start asking you words. Select the english transliteration that aligns with the word.
        After multiple of these, you will automatically be placed on level 2, where the letters get a bit trickier. Reach level 3, I'd say your doing pretty good with your letters.
        But here at level 4, you start having to do words. Reach level 5, you're really good at this!
    </p>
    <h2>How to skip to another level</h2>
    <p>Skipping to another level is more like for someone who wants to focus on a certain part of the words/letters. Click on the level selector and select your desired level.</p>
    <h1>Don't forget to have fun! Just because your learning something, doesn't mean you can't have fun!</h1>
    <h1><em>I would like some feedback on this game, things that could be added, things to be improved, and whatnot. Please reach out if you have any.</em></h1>
