# AlephBeis  
*A fun and interactive game to learn Hebrew!*  

## How to Play ðŸ“–  

The game is split into two different modes:  
1. **Progressive Mode** â€“ Start from the beginning and work your way up.  
2. **Level Selection** â€“ Jump to any level you want to practice specific words or letters.  

###  Playing in Progressive Mode  
1. The game starts immediately by asking you to match Hebrew words with their English transliterations.  
2. As you answer correctly, you advance to higher levels:  
   - **Level 1**: Basic letter recognition  
   - **Level 2**: More advanced letters  
   - **Level 3**: Mastering letter combinations  
   - **Level 4**: Word formation  
   - **Level 5**: Full proficiency! ðŸŽ‰  
3. Keep progressing and improving as you play!  

###  Jumping to a Specific Level  
- Use the **Level Selector** to skip to any level and focus on specific words or letters.  

## Have Fun!  
Learning should be fun! Even though you're learning Hebrew, you can still enjoy the game.  

## Feedback & Suggestions   
I would love your feedback! If you have any suggestions for improvements, new features, or anything else, please report it on the Issues page of this repository. Your input helps make AlephBeis even better!  

## Future plans for the game
I would like to implement a scoreboard into this game at some point, showing the most recent top 15 high scores. My plan is to use a simple api where the scores are stored in a Google Sheet, and it posts and gets from that api.
